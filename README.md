# vassar_pascal_compiler

Compiler for a subset of the Pascal language. Compiles to Vassar Intrepreter 3-address intermediate code (https://github.com/vassar-cmpu-331/TVI). Written in CS-331 at Vassar College in 2016. Everything is complete and working except for a few bugs in the semantic actions for handling procedures.
